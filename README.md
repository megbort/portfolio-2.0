# Portfolio v2.0

This portfolio is built on the same core concepts and code I used when I first started learning web development, but much of it has been refactored and expanded as my skills have grown. It’s a simple, static site using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—a great place to practice and revisit the fundamentals while keeping things clean and straightforward.
